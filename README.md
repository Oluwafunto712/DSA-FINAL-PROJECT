DSA PROJECT
My dataset consisted of two tables. 
I began by creating a database and importing the tables. 
During the import process, I defined primary keys to maintain data integrity.
Next, I performed data cleaning
	•	Removed unnecessary columns.
	•	Standardized the format of numerical values by adjusting the number of decimal places.
	•	Checked for and handled null values in rows.
	After completing the cleaning process, I proceeded to answer the analysis questions based on the refined dataset.
