 I cleaned and transformed the dataset to make it ready for analysis.

I Removed unnecessary columns, such as image links, product links and blank fields.

 Dropped rows with missing values in important fields like product name, price, and rating.

 Standardized numeric columns (price, rating, review count) to ensure accurate calculations.

These changes made the data consistent, clean, and ready for analysis.
